"""Example script demonstrating the computation of blade stiffness matrices.

This script shows how to use the OpenSG package to:
1. Load mesh data from a YAML file
2. Create a BladeMesh object
3. Generate segment meshes
4. Compute ABD and stiffness matrices for each segment
5. Save the results

The script processes a wind turbine blade mesh and computes its structural
properties using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories.
