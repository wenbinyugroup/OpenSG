used throughout opensg documentation and code. 

Terminology
-----------

ABD Matrix: A 6x6 matrix used in classical lamination theory to relate generalized forces and moments to generalized strains and curvatures. The matrix has the structure [[A, B], [B, D]] where A is the membrane stiffness, B is the coupling stiffness, and D is the bending stiffness.

Boundary Condition: A condition imposed on facets or boundaries of a mesh, 
such as Dirichlet boundary conditions (specifying function values on the boundary) 
or Neumann boundary conditions (specifying derivative values).

Cell: A fundamental element of a mesh (e.g., a triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D) 
that divides the domain into discrete parts for FEA computations.

Composite Laminate: A structural material made up of multiple layers (plies) of fiber-reinforced material, each potentially having different fiber orientations and material properties.

Composite Layup: See Composite Laminate.

Connectivity: The relationship between different entities in a mesh 
(e.g., between vertices and cells, cells and facets). 
Connectivity maps define how entities are connected within a mesh.

Dehomogenization: The process of recovering local stress and strain fields from homogenized beam properties using fluctuating functions. This allows analysis of detailed stress distributions within the original 3D structure.

Eigenvalue Analysis: Mathematical technique used to determine natural frequencies, buckling loads, or other critical values by solving generalized eigenvalue problems of the form Ax = Î»Bx.

Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory: A classical beam theory that assumes plane sections remain plane and perpendicular to the neutral axis after deformation. Neglects shear deformation effects.

Facet: A boundary entity of a cell that is one dimension lower than the cell itself.

Fluctuating Functions: Mathematical functions that represent the deviation from average behavior in homogenization theory. Used to capture local effects within the Structure Genome.

Frame: Local coordinate system defined at each point in the mesh, typically consisting of orthogonal unit vectors (e1, e2, e3) that define material orientations.

Gamma Functions: Mathematical operators (gamma_h, gamma_e, gamma_l, gamma_d) used in MSG formulations to relate displacement fields to strain measures for different beam theories.

Homogenization: The process of computing effective structural properties (stiffness matrices, mass properties) from detailed 3D finite element analysis of representative cross-sections.

Layup: The sequence and orientation of composite layers (plies) that make up a laminated structure, including thickness, material, and fiber angle for each layer.

Local Frame: A coordinate system attached to specific geometric entities (edges, faces) that defines the orientation of materials and the direction of structural axes.

Mesh: A collection of cells (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals in 2D, or tetrahedrons, 
hexahedrons in 3D) representing a discretized computational domain. 
A dolfinx.mesh.Mesh object encapsulates both the geometry and topology of this mesh.

Nullspace: In finite element analysis, the mathematical space containing rigid body motions that must be constrained to ensure a unique solution to the structural problem.

Segment: A portion of a blade mesh that is analyzed as a separate entity. Wind turbine blades are typically divided into multiple segments along their span for analysis.

Shell Element: A finite element type used for modeling thin-walled structures like wind turbine blade skins.

Solid Element: A finite element type used for modeling three-dimensional volumetric structures.

Stiffness Matrix: A matrix that relates applied forces to resulting displacements in a structural system. Can be 4x4 for Euler-Bernoulli beams or 6x6 for Timoshenko beams.

Structure Gene (SG): The fundamental building block in MSG theory - a representative cross-section of the structure that captures all geometric and material complexity in 1D, 2D, or 3D form.

Timoshenko Beam Theory: An enhanced beam theory that includes the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia, providing more accurate results for thick beams or shells.

Topology: In dolfinx, refers to the structural organization of the mesh, including 
the number and types of entities (vertices, edges, faces, cells) and their connectivity.
